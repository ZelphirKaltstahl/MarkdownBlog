# Short Introduction to Little Fighter 2

I've tried to write an introduction for Little Fighter 2 many times before and never I've been satisfied with the result. Maybe that's because I am an experienced player and always want to tell people more about the details. However, I'll try to write a good introduction, that helps people to understand what's so special about Little Fighter 2.

## General Information

Little Fighter is a Beat 'em Up for Windows. You control your character using keyboard or game pad or any other device that will be recognized as game pad. The controls are simple. You only need seven keys to control your character: Up, Down, Left, Right, Defend, Attack and Jump.

The game can be played in single player mode or multiplayer mode, in network or on only one computer. There is an unusual amount of modes in this game. You can play Versus, Stage, Championship or Battle Mode. In case you want to lean back and observe, you can choose Demo Mode. In contrast to other Beat 'em Ups, you often have more than one opponent at the same time and you are fighting in a semi three-dimensional area, where you can go left, right, up, down, jump or roll.

Each player has a HP bar and a MP bar. You usually (there are exceptions) lose HP when you get hit and use MP to execute special moves. Your amount of MP increases over time until it reaches it's maximum. HP slowly regenerate as well, up to a certain amount.

You can choose from 21 characters, which one you want to play, so there is plenty of change and you can find the one which fits you best.

## Game Modes

I want to explain the game modes a little bit more, because I think the combination of available game modes are one of the features, which make Little Fighter 2 unique.

### VS Mode

First of all there is the Versus Mode. In Versus Mode you fight one or more opponents at the same time. You choose one of the 21 characters or choose, that the character will be random. Then you can choose 1 of 4 teams or go for independent, which means not being in a team. Your opponents do the same and the fight can begin. Additionally you can choose on which map and on which difficulty you want to fight. The difficulty only influences the AI. That's right, you can play against the computer too. In this case you'll have to choose a character for them or let the character be random.

### Stage Mode

Next we have the Stage Mode, which actually consists of 2 modes, the original Stage Mode and the Survival Mode, which was added in version 2.0. The Stage Mode is more complex than the Versus Mode. You cannot choose a team, but will automatically be in team 1, working together with your teammates in fighting the AI. In this mode you can select a difficulty like in Versus Mode. This time your opponents will enter the map from the left or from the right, instead of simply being there from the start. Once you beat them, there will be a new wave of opponents until you finished the stage. There are 5 stages, which become increasingly difficult to beat.

The waves of opponents have a structure. What I mean by 'structure' is, that there can be bosses and soldiers. As long as a boss is still alive, the soldiers will keep coming, no matter how often you beat them. There is also the possibility, that an opponent appears a predefined number of times.

Additionally you can free allies who might help you beating your opponents.

### Survival Mode

For Survival Mode the same is true, however, you cannot really finish Survival Mode, because it is programmed in a way, so that there will always be a next wave of opponents. Also there are no allies you can free. It's about surviving as long as you can and coming as far as you can. This gave Little Fighter 2 players a way of setting world records. A few friends and I hold many of these records and we're still trying to beat some of the records we aren't holding.

### Championship Mode

Championship Mode is a game mode we usually play when we don't know what else to do. It's simply a mode that puts you into a little K.O. tournament with the AI or other human players. Each fight is equal to a fight in Versus Mode. However, if you lose HP, you'll have less HP in the next fight.

There are 2 versions of Championship Mode, 1on1 Championship and 2on2 Championship. In 1on1 Championship you are alone fighting one other player, while in 2on2 Championship you fight with one ally against two opponents.

### Battle Mode

In this mode you can simulate Stage Mode situations. You can choose a character and add an army to your or your opponents side. Additionally to map and difficulty, you can choose a defense multiplier. This multiplier influences, how much damage your character can take. For example x3.0 means, that you'll only take one third of the usual damage if you get hit.

### Demo Mode

The demo mode simply lets a random amount of AI players fight each other.

## Combos

No matter in which mode you play, the moves and special moves of the characters can be combined in many ways to create awesome combos. I am still wondering, which approach the developers used to allow such combo variety and at the same time to not allow every move to hit all the time. This is something that Little Fighter 2 really excels in. Somehow all the characters fit together, as do their moves and special moves and although they fit together so well, it still feels different to play from character to character.

Creating combo possibilities in a beat 'em up game that only allows 1on1 fights is an easy task compared to creating the carefully balanced amount of 'combo-bilitiy' you can see in Little Fighter 2. So I am impressed by how well it's done in Little Fighter 2.

## Input System

The input system of LF2 is special as well and in a good way. If you've played any other fighting game on consoles, chances are, that you're familiar with the concept of buffering. In Little Fighter 2 everything is buffered for an infinite amount of time. The input for a special move can only be interrupted by wrong key presses.

For people who do not know buffering, I will explain the input system now.

There are the basic moves `^`, `>`, `v`, `<`, `A`, `D`, `J` (for more information about the LF2 input notation I refer to the [LF2 Blog](/lf2/blog)). Special moves are triggered when you press combinations of those basic moves at the same time or in a specific order. A special move almost always has the following input parts:

1. defend `D`
2. a direction `^`/`>`/`v`/`<`
3. jump or attack `J`/`A`

This is also the order, in which you need to press the associated keys, to trigger the special move. You can take your time doing that. You could really press a button, be afk for an hour, press a second button, go for a walk and then press the third button. The game would do that special move, it buffered your previous inputs, nothing gets lost, except in most cases your health points, because some opponent is attacking you. There are very few exceptions to this input rule. Those are:

* Louis' transformation to LouisEx (`DJA` while less than $\frac{1}{3}$ HP)
* Rudolf's transformation into another character (`DJA` while grabbing)
* Julian's illusion move (`DJA`)
* Henry's 5 arrows move (`DJA`)

So all the exceptions use the same input. There is a rule to the exceptions : )

Rarely though you might want to do a basic move and then accidentally perform a special move, because of the eternal buffering. One example:

* You're doing the _whirl wind kick_ with Dennis and want to stop and turn around to attack some, so you press `D` to stop doing the _whirl wind kick_. Then you press `<` or `>`, depending on which direction you want to turn. Then you press `A` to perform a simple _kick_. However, if you look at those last three inputs again, you will probably realize something. `D>A` or `D<A` is the input for a special move, the _energy blast_ to be precise. This may or may not cause you trouble with the opponents, but there is an easy fix for that. Simply press `^`, `v` or only one of them before you perform your basic move. You can even do that, while you are still stopping the _whirl wind kick_.

There is another great thing about the input system, I want to mention. Some moves in the game can be canceled, like Dennis' _whirl wind kick_ as described above, others cannot and thus can be more committal. However, while you perform _any_ move, you can already enter the input for the next move! Let us have another example:

* You are doing the so called _Schnetzler_ `D>J` or `D<J` with Deep. You want to do the _Leap Attack_ or so called _BISprung_ `D^J` immediately after the _Schnetzler_ for some reason. _Schnetzler_ is a very committal move, you cannot interrupt it yourself at any point during execution. What you do is you press the input for the next move, the _Leap Attack_ in the input order explained above: `D`, `^`, `J`. Then you simply wait. When the _Schnetzler_ is done, Deep will asap perform the _Leap Attack_. This can also be used form energy blasts or other moves, basically whenever you want to perform another move without having a break in between your moves, caused by being a human at inputting your moves and not being infinitely fast. This is very useful and almost always used while playing.

One more thing. You can also usually hold down a direction and while holding it down enter the input for another special move. The game will not count the held down button to the input of the special move in this case.

So there is no downside to this input system. It is easy to handle and the game is more about doing the right thing at the right time, than about mastering the difficulties of the input system. This is why people can become decent players quickly. To master the game however, it can take years, because it is more about doing the right thing, than pressing the buttons in a very skilled manner. This is actually a part of LF2, which I like. It might not look like it from an outside perspective, but from the perspective of someone, who has played it for a year or two, you can see how the brain is involved.
