# LF2 as Webapp

I've read about it some time ago, but recently someone reminded me of a [project](https://github.com/Project-F). The project is to make LF2 for the browser. They're pretty far with this already. Here you can test [the project](http://www.projectf.hk/F.LF/game/game.html).

There are still many differences between the web app and the actual game. I think in its current state it's not close to being a comparable experience. Some of the problem are:

* Input Lag: You cannot enter moves as quickly as in the real game.
* Different physics: When you get hit and fall, sometimes you fly away much further that you would in the actual game.
* Some combos seem not to work. For example grab someone with Dennis and try `DvA`.
* It seems grabbing also happens when pressing `^` and `v`, instead of only when pressing `>` and `<`, when close to an opponent in _DOP_.
* The AI is totally different. It's not really much smarter, but rather a different kind of dumb. I am not sure if this is an AI one would want to have in the game, when considering other modes than VS.

However, I think the team should be congratulated to even get this far. There are some undocumented states in the characters data files, so it's really hard to achieve almost 100% compatibility. It remains to be seen if this project will one day be able to offer the real Little Fighter 2 experience in the browser. Even with LF2 now running on Linux without issues, a web app LF2 would be quite desirable, because it does not require any additional tools other than a browser to be accessable.
