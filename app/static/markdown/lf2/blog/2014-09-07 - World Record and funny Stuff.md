# World Record and funny stuff

Today we made a world record attempt again and this time we succeeded. This time we tried **3x LouisEx** on **Difficult Survival Mode**. We reached **stage 77**, which is quite good. Personally I hoped for stage 78, but we were on the brink of death for such a long time, that stage 77 is still a satisfying result. In the same recording we have some good combos and other funny stuff:

* Firzen single-handedly kicks our asses - Stage 29
* 738 damage combo on Knight - Stage 30
* Super skilled Knights trick Dragon and deal good damage - Stage 30
* 483 damage combo on Julian - Stage 60
