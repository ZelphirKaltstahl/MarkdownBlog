# Recordings of 23rd of December 2014

Yesterday we almost made ourselves the best christmas present we could've wished for:

* Original Survival Mode, 3 Player, Crazy, Stage 30: [Download](https://app.box.com/s/sk08hmkvynqgpw09yxsg)

Julian was already dead and Panu was fighting for his life there. He almost beat all of them alone after Dragon and I died, but in the end it was not enough. I couldn't help myself to cry out _"Nooooo!"_ when he died in stage 30.

This might not have been a successful attempt on finally beating stage 30, but it showed us, that stage 30 is beatable, even if we don't use unfair means like Henry's Sonatha of Death.
