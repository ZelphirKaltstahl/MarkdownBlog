%title: Coursera Course finished!

I just completed my first Coursera course in Machine Learning (ML). The course is about classification, which is one of the big topics in ML. I finished with 95.1% grade, which would probably have been even a little better, if I repeated some of the quizes, to get rid of silly mistakes like not entering a decimal dot or stuff like that, but my 95.1% would be a 1.0 in the German grading system at universities, so I am quite satisfied with my grade.

Now I have some examples in Jupyter notebooks, nicely documented and described by markdown cells, explaining every step on the way, ready for being looked up, whenever I need them and I gained some knowledge about how to handle data in general, before even touching it with any ML algorithms. I also have some manual implementations of logistic regression and decision trees in there. Those were the two classes of ML algorithms, which the course taught.

I started translating the course to German on their transifex website. Not always easy to translate spoken language, especially, when there are parts of phrases missing, but since I finished the course, I know what the lecturer means. Not sure if I can translate all of that on my own though. Maybe while watching series, step by step ...

It's time for me to go on exploring and finding more good courses, to learn more about ML.
