% title: Online Courses

E-Learning is becomming more and more a common thing. Universities, which do not offer it, start to seem technologically backward. There are even projects, which go beyond the boundaries of one university and share knowledge with everyone, who is connected to the internet. Their websites offer many online courses for all sorts of areas of expertise. They also offer courses for many aspects of software development, which is why I want to mention a few of those websites here.

* [coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org)
* [udacity.com](https://www.udacity.com)
* [khanacademy.org](https://www.khanacademy.org)
* [codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com)

It is worth checking these websites out when you look for interesting courses to study or when you search for a lecture about some topic. It is also useful for learning about new technologies as they grow more and more important or new trends in the IT world, because there will usually pop up some courses for skills high in demand. The amount of courses there showed me how much machine learning is in demand for example. It also shows how Python gets more and more popular even in other disciplines, than computer science. There are many courses, which introduce Python specifically for one use case. This is so, because there are many useful libraries aiming at providing functionality for specific areas of expertise. Even for computer science students some of these more specific programming courses can be interesting and educating.

There are other websites with online courses around, but those are popular ones, I know of.
